I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University, advised by [José Luis Montiel Olea](https://joseluismontielolea.com), [Peng Ding](https://sites.google.com/site/pengdingpku/), and [Francesca Molinari](https://molinari.economics.cornell.edu/). My research focuses on econometrics and applied econometrics, with a particular interest in latent variable model. I hold a B.S. in Economics and Mathematics from Renmin University of China. 

I am on the 2025-2026 economics job market. You can find my CV [here](https://dingyili93.github.io/files/CV_Dingyi.pdf).
