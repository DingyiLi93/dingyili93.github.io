I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University. My research focuses on econometrics, with a particular interest in, casual inference, latent variables, and machine learning. I hold a B.S. in Economics and Mathematics from Renmin University of China and will be on the 2025-2026 economics job market.
