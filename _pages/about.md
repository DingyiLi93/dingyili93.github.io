I am a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University, advised by [Jos√© Luis Montiel Olea](https://joseluismontielolea.com). My research focuses on econometrics and applied econometrics, with a particular interest in latent variable model. I hold a B.S. in Economics and Mathematics from Renmin University of China and will be on the 2025-2026 economics job market.
